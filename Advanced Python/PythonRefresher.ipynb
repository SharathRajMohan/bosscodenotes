    "## Important Concepts in Python Refresher 1\n",
    "- What is Python?\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it an ideal choice for both beginners and experienced programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - High-Level Language: Python is a high-level language, meaning it abstracts away most of the complex details of the computer’s hardware. This allows developers to focus on writing logic rather than managing memory and other lower-level tasks.\n",
    "    - Interpreted Language: Unlike compiled languages (like C or C++), Python is interpreted. This means that Python code is executed line-by-line, which facilitates a rapid development cycle. However, it may also result in slower execution speeds compared to compiled languages.\n",
    "- Data Types\n",
    "    - Primitive data types - Primitive data types, also known as basic or fundamental data types, are the most basic types of data that are built into a programming language. They serve as the building blocks for data manipulation and are typically defined at the language level. Primitive data types are not composed of other data types and generally represent single values.\n",
    "    - Container - In Python, container data types are types that can hold multiple items or elements. These items can be of any data type, including other containers. Containers provide ways to group related data and manage collections of items efficiently\n",
    "- Variables\n",
    "    - Local Variables: Declared inside a function and can only be accessed within that function.\n",
    "    - Global Variables: Declared outside any function and can be accessed globally throughout the program.\n",
    "- Keywords: Python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can’t be used for anything but those specific purposes. These keywords are always available—you’ll never have to import them into your code.\n",
    "- Inputs\n",
    "- Operators\n",
    "- Type Casting\n",
    "    - Implicit Typecasting: Implicit typecasting occurs automatically when Python converts one data type to another without the need for explicit intervention by the user. This usually happens when performing operations between different data types.\n",
    "    - Explicit Typecasting: Explicit typecasting is performed when the programmer explicitly converts one data type to another using built-in functions. This is also known as type conversion.\n",
    "        - Typecasting in Python is a powerful tool that allows for the conversion of one data type to another, enabling the programmer to manipulate and work with data more effectively. Understanding both implicit and explicit typecasting is essential for writing efficient and bug-free Python code.\n",
    "## Important Concepts in Python Refresher 2\n",
    "- Slicing\n",
    "    - Index: An index is a single character or element's location within a string, tuple, or list. Regardless of the number of items, the index value always begins at zero and ends at one less. Indexing helps us retrieve values from the collection.\n",
    "        - Positive Indexing: indexing the elements from the start of the members.\n",
    "        - Negative Indexing: indexing from the last element to the first.\n",
    "    - Slicing: allows you to extract specific parts of sequences such as strings, lists, or tuples by specifying a range of indices. The basic syntax for slicing is:\n",
    "        - object[start:stop:step]\n",
    "            - start: The starting index of the slice. The element at this index is included in the slice.\n",
    "            - stop: The ending index of the slice. The element at this index is not included in the slice.\n",
    "            - step: The interval between elements in the slice. This parameter is optional and defaults to 1.\n",
    "        - object[-1:0:-1] --> Is used to for Reversing the order in which the list is accessed. The element starts from the end and setting step to -1, this decrements th index  by 1 all the way till the end.\\\n",
    "        - Using out of bound indexes as either start, stop or step does not yield an error.\n",
    "        - Step can not be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Control Flow: The order of execution of the program.\n",
    "    - Sequential Execution: the statements are executed one after the other sequentially.\n",
    "    - Conditional Execution: Statements are executed based on the condition. If the condition is true then one set of statements are executed, and if false then the other set.\n",
    "        - pass Statement:  is a null statement which the interpreter simply 'moves over' while executing the code. It can be used in a variety of scenarios where you want to leave parts of your code undefined (such as if-else, loops, classes or methods) but the Python syntax doesn't allow it.\n",
    "        - Control flow can be combined with error handling using try and except statements. This allows programs to manage exceptions gracefully.\n",
    "        - Match Statement (Switch case in Python): \n",
    "    - Looping:Loops are tools that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. They are helpful when you need to perform the same action or set of actions many times, such as iterating over items in a list or repeating an operation until a certain condition is met.\n",
    "- Loops: are tools that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. They are helpful when you need to perform the same action or set of actions many times, such as iterating over items in a list or repeating an operation until a certain condition is met.\n",
    "    - Types of Loops:\n",
    "        - For Loop (Controlled loop/Sequence based loop): A for loop is a type of loop that is used to iterate over a sequence of values. In Python, a sequence can be any iterable object, such as a list, tuple, or string.\n",
    "            - Used when the number of iterations required is known.\n",
    "        - While Loop (Conditional Loop): A while loop is another type of loop in Python. Unlike a for loop, which iterates over a sequence of values, a while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.\n",
    "            - Used whe the number of iterations is not known.\n",
    "    - A nested loop in Python is a loop inside another loop. The \"outer\" loop controls the number of times the \"inner\" loop executes. Nested loops are useful when you need to perform repeated actions on multiple dimensions, such as iterating over a matrix or grid.\n",
    "    - The break statement breaks out of the innermost enclosing for or while loop\n",
    "    - The continue statement continues with the next iteration of the loop\n",
    "    - else Clauses on Loops\n",
    "        - In a for loop, the else clause is executed after the loop finishes its final iteration, that is, if no break occurred.\n",
    "        - In a while loop, it’s executed after the loop’s condition becomes false.\n",
    "        - In either kind of loop, the else clause is not executed if the loop was terminated by a break. Of course, other ways of ending the loop early, such as a return or a raised exception, will also skip execution of the else clause.\n",
    "- Lists: A list is a versatile data structure that allows you to store a collection of items in a single variable. Lists can hold items of different types and are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed after creation.\n",
    "    - List Operations\n",
    "        1. append(): Adds an item to the end of the list.\n",
    "        2. insert(pos, elmnt): Inserts an item at a specified position.\n",
    "        3. pop()\n",
    "        4. len()\n",
    "        5. sort()\n",
    "        6. clear()\n",
    "        7. copy()\n",
    "        8. count()\n",
    "        9. extend()\n",
    "        10. index()\n",
    "        11. remove()\n",
    "        12. reverse()\n",
    "        13. sort() \n",

    "        - Mutable:\n",
    "        - Dynamic Size:\n",
    "        - Allows Duplicate Elements\n",
    "        - Indexed\n",
    "        - Allows mixed data types:\n",
    "        - Supports Nesting:\n",
    "        - Supports Slicing\n",
    "        - Iterable\n",
    "        - Variable length\n",
    "        - Supports insertion and deletion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strings: Strings are a sequence of characters used to store and manipulate text.\n",
    "    - Properties of string:\n",
    "        * **Immutable**: Strings cannot be changed after they are created. Any operation that modifies a string will create a new string.\n",
    "        * **Ordered**: Strings maintain the order of characters. The order in which characters are added to the string is preserved.\n",
    "        * **Indexed**: Characters in a string can be accessed by their index, starting from 0.\n",
    "        * **Iterable**: Strings are iterable, meaning you can loop through each character in the string.\n",
    "    - Common String Methods:\n",
    "        1. len()\n",
    "        2. str.lower()\n",
    "        3. str.upper()\n",
    "        4. str.strip()\n",
    "        5. str.replace()\n",
    "        6. str.split()\n",
    "        7. str.join()\n",
    "        \n",
    "## Important Concepts in Python Refresher 3\n",
    "- Tuple: A tuple is an immutable, ordered collection of elements. Tuples are similar to lists, but unlike lists, tuples cannot be changed (they are immutable). This makes them ideal for storing data that should not be modified, such as database records.\n",
    "    - Properties of Tuples:\n",
    "        * **Ordered:** Tuples maintain the order of elements, meaning the sequence in which elements are defined is preserved.\n",
    "        * **Immutable:** Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified, added, or removed. This immutability ensures that the data remains constant.\n",
    "        * **Allow Duplicates:** Tuples can contain duplicate elements, meaning the same value can appear multiple times within the same tuple.\n",
    "        * **Indexed:** Elements in a tuple can be accessed using zero-based indexing, allowing for retrieval of specific elements by their position.\n",
    "        * **Heterogeneous:** Tuples can contain a mix of different data types, including integers, floats, strings, and other tuples.\n",
    "        * **Hashable:** If all elements within a tuple are hashable, the tuple itself can be used as a key in a dictionary. This is due to the immutability of tuples.\n",
    "        * **Fixed Size:** The size of a tuple is determined at the time of its creation and cannot be changed afterward, meaning elements cannot be added or removed.\n",
    "        * **Iterable:** Tuples can be looped over, meaning you can iterate through each element in a tuple using a loop.\n",
    "        * **Concatenable:** Tuples can be concatenated using the + operator to form a new tuple that combines the elements of the original tuples.\n",
    "        * **Repetition:** Tuples can be repeated using the * operator to form a new tuple with the original elements repeated a specified number of times.\n",
    "        * **Unpacking:** Tuples support unpacking, which allows you to assign the elements of a tuple to a corresponding number of variables in a single operation.\n",
    "        * **Nestable:** Tuples can contain other tuples as elements, allowing for the creation of complex, nested data structures.\n",
    "    - Tuple Methods: Tuples have a limited number of built-in methods compared to lists due to their immutable nature.\n",
    "        - count(x): Returns the number of times the element x appears in the tuple.\n",
